## **How to Use**
To use any of the tools or projects in this repository:
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/O365-Automation-and-AD-Management-Tools.git
   cd O365-Automation-and-AD-Management-Tools
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Specific Folder**:  
   Each folder contains usage instructions in the **README.md**.  

3. **Run PowerShell Scripts**:
   Execute scripts directly from PowerShell with administrative privileges:
   ```powershell
   ./Active-Directory/AD-User-Creation/AD-Creation-Basic/ad-creation-basic.ps1
   ```

---

## **Best Practices**
- **Test in a Non-Production Environment**: Avoid running scripts directly in production environments.  
- **Use `-WhatIf`**: Run PowerShell scripts with `-WhatIf` to preview the impact.  
- **Log Migrations**: Track Exchange migrations using the **migration-logs** folder.  
- **Security-First Approach**: Never hardcode sensitive data in scripts. Use the **.gitignore** to protect secrets.
