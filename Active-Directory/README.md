# PowerShell Scripts

The **Active Directory** directory contains a collection of PowerShell scripts designed to automate key IT administrative tasks. This includes **Active Directory (AD) user management** and **O365 Hybrid management**.

These scripts are written with a focus on:  
- **Automation and Efficiency**: Reduce manual effort through automated workflows.  
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensure scripts follow industry best practices and security-first principles.  
- **Reusability and Modularity**: Designed to be reusable and modifiable for future needs.

## **Directory Breakdown**
Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s in each folder and why it matters.

This directory contains scripts for **Active Directory user creation**. It includes scripts for:  
- **Basic AD User Creation**: Simple user creation with basic properties.  
- **Detailed AD User Creation**: More robust version with advanced properties, input validation, and enhanced logging.  
- **O365 Hybrid User Creation**: Handles **hybrid user creation** for environments where AD syncs with Office 365.  

**Subdirectories and Key Files**  
| **File/Folder**              | **Purpose**                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

## **Security Best Practices**
1. **Use `-WhatIf`**: Use PowerShell's **`-WhatIf`** switch to preview the changes before applying them.  
2. **Test in a Safe Environment**: Always test scripts in a non-production environment.  
3. **Avoid Hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data. Use secure input prompts where possible.  
4. **Track Logs**: Review logs (if implemented) to ensure successful execution.
