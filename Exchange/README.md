## **Security Considerations**
- **Avoid hardcoding passwords**: Use secure prompts or **SecureString** for passwords.
- **Follow least privilege principles**: Run scripts using a service account with the least privileges required to complete the task.
- **Use secure storage**: Do not store sensitive information (like credentials) in the script. Instead, prompt for them when needed.
